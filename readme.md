### Why do I trust you?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

# Background

### What is ‘Root Chain’? (name)

We adopt blockchain technology and work on the fruit supply chain process, that’s why we chose to use this name. We hope you can enjoy better and cheaper fruits by knowing the origins and the transportation processes of them. You can know them inside out without worries.

### What does ‘Root Chain’ do?

Our project aimed to:

1) let customers understand more about the food we buy and eat not by guessing or google translate

2) maintain the quality and freshness of the products

3) build trust between all the stakeholders in the supply chain process

### What is your mission?

We would like to create a transparent and traceable supply chain system. By creating a transparent and traceable supply chain. Root chain adopted blockchain technology. As the specialities of blockchain technology are transparency, immutable, and not owned by anyone, it ensures that the story of the goods is not tampered by any nodes or being monopolized. Based on these specialities, blockchain technology is more suitable to build trust between each stakeholder in the supply chain process. Especially, there are a lot of stakeholders working in the supply chain. The more people in there the harder to build trust. However, no matter how many people need to be involved. Trust can still be built among all of the nodes when we adapt the blockchain system appropriately. 

### Where do your products from?

In Phase 1, our products mostly come from some premium and licensed ( by Japan Agriculture Association) strawberry farms in Japan. We support organic farms which have favourable air,water and soil quality.

### What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology — distributed meaning not kept by one bookkeeper; a ledger is a book of records — where tamperproof records are shared among a group, so that they can form a consensus about a single truth.

This allows parties that don’t fully trust each other to work together without the need of trusting each other nor does it need to place their trust collectively upon a central authority. 

Hence, blockchain solutions are sometimes synonymous with the term “decentralised applications” even though decentralisation is not the only nor the key benefit.
